- üìà Generates comprehensive code coverage reports
- üîç Provides PR-specific coverage analysis and validation
- üìã Creates PR coverage comment data for integration

#### Code Coverage (PR Pipeline)
- Uses Coverlet collector for accurate coverage measurement
- Generates multiple formats: Cobertura, OpenCover, LCOV, JSON
- Publishes coverage data to Azure DevOps
- Shows line and branch coverage metrics with PR-specific thresholds
- Provides coverage validation and recommendations

#### Security Scanning
- **Main Pipeline**: Advanced security scanning with OWASP Dependency Check
- **PR Pipeline**: .NET built-in security tools (vulnerability, deprecated, outdated checks)
- **Dependency Scanning**: Checks for vulnerable, deprecated, and outdated NuGet packages
- **Code Analysis**: Static Application Security Testing with pattern matching
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Scans for common security issues and hardcoded secrets
- **Advanced Analysis**: SQL injection, XSS, and insecure deserialization pattern detection

## Usage Instructions

### For Pull Requests
1. Create a pull request to `master` or `develop`
2. The following pipeline will automatically trigger:
   - `pr-validation-pipeline.yml` - Comprehensive build, test, and security validation

### For Main Branch Commits
1. Push directly to `master` or `develop`
2. The following pipeline will automatically trigger:
   - `foundation-azure-pipelines.yml` - Build, package, security scan, and publish

### Manual Pipeline Execution
You can manually trigger any pipeline from Azure DevOps:
1. Go to Pipelines in Azure DevOps
2. Select the desired pipeline
3. Click "Run pipeline"
4. Choose branch and parameters

### Pipeline Results
- **Build Status**: Check if all projects compile successfully
- **Test Results**: View test execution results and coverage (PR pipeline)
- **Security Reports**: Review security analysis and vulnerability reports
- **Artifacts**: Download build outputs, test reports, and security analysis

## Pipeline Variables

| Variable | Description | Default Value |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| `buildConfiguration` | Build configuration | `Release` |
| `solution` | Solution file pattern | `**/*.sln` |
| `testProject` | Test project path | `GCFoundation.Tests.Components/GCFoundation.Tests.Components.csproj` |
| `componentsProject` | Components project path | `GCFoundation.Components/CGFoundation.Components.csproj` |
| `commonProject` | Common project path | `GCFoundation.Common/GCFoundation.Common.csproj` |
| `securityProject` | Security project path | `GCFoundation.Security/GCFoundation.Security.csproj` |
| `webProject` | Web project path | `GCFoundation.Web/GCFoundation.Web.csproj` |
| `outputDir` | NuGet package output directory | `$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/nuget` |
| `nugetSource` | NuGet feed name | `TBS_Custom_Feed` |

## Pipeline Stages

### Main Pipeline (`foundation-azure-pipelines.yml`)
1. **Build Stage**: Parallel build matrix for all projects
2. **Security Stage**: Advanced security scanning and analysis
3. **Package Stage**: NuGet package publishing (non-PR builds only)

### PR Pipeline (`pr-validation-pipeline.yml`)
1. **Build Stage**: Parallel build matrix for all projects
2. **Test Stage**: Test execution, coverage analysis, and security scanning

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**
   - Check if all dependencies are restored
   - Verify .NET SDK version compatibility
   - Ensure all project references are valid
   - For Components project: Verify NPM packages are installed

2. **Test Failures**
   - Review test output for specific failure reasons
   - Check if test dependencies are properly configured
   - Verify test project builds successfully
   - **Common Fix**: Ensure test project has `<IsTestProject>true</IsTestProject>` property
   - **Common Fix**: Remove `<OutputType>Exe</OutputType>` from test project (should be Library)

3. **Pipeline Not Triggering**
   - Ensure branch names match trigger conditions
   - Check if pipeline is enabled in Azure DevOps
   - Verify agent pool availability

4. **Test Discovery Issues**
   - Verify test project references the correct test framework packages
   - Check that test classes and methods have proper attributes ([Fact], [Test], etc.)
   - Ensure test project builds without errors

5. **Security Scanning Issues**
   - Check if security tools are properly installed
   - Verify network access for OWASP Dependency Check downloads
   - Review security analysis logs for specific error messages

### Local Troubleshooting

Run the included `test-troubleshoot.ps1` script to diagnose test issues locally:

```powershell
./test-troubleshoot.ps1
```

This script will:
- ‚úÖ Check .NET SDK availability
- üìÅ Verify test project and files exist
- üì¶ Restore NuGet packages
- üî® Build the test project
- üß™ Run tests with different verbosity levels

### Test Project Configuration

Ensure your test project has the correct configuration:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
    <IsTestProject>true</IsTestProject>
    <!-- Remove <OutputType>Exe</OutputType> if present -->
  </PropertyGroup>
  
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk" Version="17.13.0" />
    <PackageReference Include="xunit" Version="2.4.2" />
    <PackageReference Include="xunit.runner.visualstudio" Version="2.4.5" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

### Pipeline Diagnostics

The updated pipelines include diagnostic steps that will:
- üîç Check test project file existence
- üìã List all test files found
- üìä Verify test results generation
- üéØ Provide detailed error information
- üîí Generate security analysis reports
- üìà Create coverage analysis with PR-specific validation
